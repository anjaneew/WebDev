/**Generics in TypeScript are a feature that allows you to write reusable code by passing a
 * type as a parameter to another type, whether it's a class, interface, or function.
 * No need to use 'any'.
 * Generics can be used in TypeScript to create:
                * Generic Classes.
                * Generic Functions.
                * Generic Interfaces.
                * Generic Methods.
