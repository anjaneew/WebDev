#Intro

TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types. It is all about type safety. Sometimes JavaScript exhibits unexpected behavior. 

For example, if you write:

`2 + "2"` 

It will return '22'. However, with TypeScript, all of these problems just disappear.

**Static typing**, is a core concept in TypeScript. Statically Typed Languages (e.g., C++, C#, Java) require declaring a variable's type at compile time or during coding.

**TypeScript is JavaScript with type checking.**
